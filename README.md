## Robust Supply Chain Optimization under Demand Uncertainty 

The goal is to design a supply chain network that performs well under uncertain demand conditions. Using Monte Carlo simulation to model demand variability and mixed-integer programming (MIP) for optimization, the project focuses on minimizing total costs like, facility operations, production, and transportation while ensuring demand is met across multiple realistic scenarios.

The motivation behind this project comes from real world supply chain disruptions and the need for networks that are not only cost efficient but also resilient to fluctuations in customer demand.
